### VARIABLE
Variabes in go are just names given to the memory locations where the actual values are stored.
Variables are also of specific types i.e string, int, float64.`var` keyword is used to define variables such as var varName type(`var intVar int`)
While assigning names to variables there should be some rules to be kept in mind
1. Name must start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers and underscore(_).Names start with small letter are unexported i.e can only be used in the same package and the names start with capital letter are exported i.e can be used in other packages which imports the current package.
2. Names should be concise i.e it should be short and should describe, what the variable does
3. It's suggested to used mixed case(camel case) names i.e`var interestRate float64`,`var UserName string`.Let's get into an example
```go
package main

import "fmt"

var globalVarInt int = 1

func main() {

    var localVarInt int = 2

    globalVarInt = 2
    fmt.Println(globalVarInt, localVarInt)
}
```
Variables declared outside of any scope are global variables and variables declared inside any scope is called local variables and are accessible only in the same scopes.Global variables are accessible throught the program.`globalVarInt` is global variable and it's accessible inside the `main` function but `localVarInt` is local variable and only be accessible inside the `main` function.

## Declaring and assigning values to a variable
There are many ways we can declar a variable in golang
##### Declaring variables with zero values
Zero values are assigned to variables by go compiler if the variables are not assigned any value at the time of declaration.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

var globalVarInt int
var globalVarBool bool

func main() {

    var localVarString string
    var localVarFloat float64
    var localVarInt int
    localVarInt = 10
    fmt.Println(globalVarInt, globalVarBool, localVarString, localVarFloat, localVarInt)
}
```
**output:** 
`0 false  0 10`  
Here `localVarInt` has assigned value 10 after it's declared with zero value.Empty string `""` is zero value of string
##### Declaring variables with inital values
```go
package main

import "fmt"

var globalVarInt int = 5
var globalVarBool = true

func main() {

    var localVarString string = "hello"
    var localVarFloat = 789.47 // type is float64
    localVarInt := 10 // short declaration
    fmt.Println(globalVarInt, globalVarBool, localVarString, localVarFloat, localVarInt)
}
```
**output:**
`5 true hello 789.47 10`  
If you are assiging value at the time of declaring the variable you can omit the type and go compiler would automatically assign the type to the variable.`localVarInt := 10` *is called short declaration and this syntax is not acceptable declaring global variables.*
##### Block declaration
We can declare variables in a single block
```go
package main

import "fmt"

var (
    name = "John"
    age = 25
    weight = 63.49
    isMarried = false
)

func main() {

    fmt.Println(name, age, weight, isMarried)
}
```
### CONSTANTS
As the name suggests, the value of constants can not be changed once declared.In case of variables we can assign new value of same type to a variable.Constants are declared using `const` keyword.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
    name = "John"
    age = 25
    weight = 63.49
    isMarried = false
)
const address = "USA"

func main() {

    fmt.Println(name, age, weight, isMarried, address)
}
```
**output:**
`John 25 63.49 false USA`
