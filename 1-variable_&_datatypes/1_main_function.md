### The Main Function
Below is a simple go program saved in a file named `main.go` but the file can be named anything.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // single line comment

    /*
    This is
    multiline comment
    */
    
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```
The above program can be run by the command `go run main.go`.
Output:
`hello world`

The first line is `package declaration`.Every go program must belongs to a particular package.
Packages are like programs bundled together to perform specific types of tasks i.e math package for performing mathematical operations.Packages are built for code reusability.We can use any package by importing it by `import` keyword.We have imported `fmt` package to print `hello world` to console or terminal.All the blank lines whitespaces are ignored by go compiler.While importing a package, the package name should be surrounded by double quotes.

`func` keyword is used to declare functions in golang, in this case `main` function is declared.Functions are used to group statements to perform certain tasks and these statements are executed only when the function is called in the program.Function names should be followed by parenthesis.Like `main`, `Println` is also a function defined in `fmt` package.To use a function defined in a package, we have to first import the package and access the function with `.` operator.The function `main` is a special function because it gets called by go compiler when we try to run the program.

Comments are used give useful information about code or to document the code etc.Like whitespaces comments are also ignored by go compiler.Comments can be added by `//`(for single line comment) or 
`/**/`(multiline comment).It is advised to add comment to your code so that it can be easily perceived what the particular piece of code does.
